# Projects
These are a few of the projects that I have been apart of over the last couple of years, either through courses, an internship, or maybe just a general interest in the subject. Each is marked by a title, where/why it was produced, and who it was that worked alongside me on the project (if anyone). To check out the project just click the title!
