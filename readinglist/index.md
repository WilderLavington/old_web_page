J. Lavington, M. Lladser, K. Tarasava
Using flourecence data provided by Katia Tarasava of the Gill Lab at University of Colorado Boulder, Prof. Manuel and myself applied our markov chain model of R-loop formation to predict gene expression within ecoli bacteria affected by the CRISPR-dCas9 mechanism.   
[A Probabalistic Modeling Approach to CRISPR-Cas9](https://wilderlavington.github.io/masters_thesis.pdf)   
J. Lavington, M. Lladser
My Master Thesis, which was completed at the University of Colorado Boulder in the Department of Applied Mathematics under Prof. Manuel E. Lladser, focused on applying simple probabalistic structures such as markov chains to accurate model biological reactions that occur within CRISPR-Cas Experimentation.
