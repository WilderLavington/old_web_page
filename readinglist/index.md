# This is my Reading List
These are some of the papers that I have been reading over that caught my attention for whatever reason. They are ordered based upon the year that I was looking through them, as well as the genre of research that encompassed them. This reading list will hohpefully be a reminder of some of the topics that I have already looked into, and the papers that I have enjoyed that survey those topics. Additionally, I hope that this list will help create a more cogent story of my research interests within optimization, reinforcement rearning and statistical inference. If you see something intersting, click on the title to read more about it!
