# My Academic Life Thus Far

After completing my degree at the University of Colorado Boulder, I was accepted to the department of computer science at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. My current research focuses on creating more princpled gradient based policy optimization algorithms for reinforcement learning. I beleive that by viewing [reinforcement learning as statistical inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00909.pdf), we can improve our understanding of optimization withing RL. If you would like to get a better idea of the kinds of papers that I am reading through at the moment, check out [my current reading list](https://wilderlavington.github.io/readinglist/).

# Everything Else!
For anyone who has visited the peoples republic of Boulder, my disposition and hobbies should come as no surprise. I am a die hard skier and mountainear, and spend what little free time I have in the out doors. While growing up in boulder both my parents climbed/hiked/backpacked as often as possible, and even climbed all 54 14ers in three weeks for a charity! My mother was also a ski instructor most winters growing up so I spent almost every weekend on a pair of boards. After getting out of high school, I took a year off and lived as a ski/mountain biking bum in Durango Colorado (and went to classes a bit too). Now that I am in Vancouver, I have all of whistler and Squamish at my disposle for all the world class climbing, biking, and skiing I could ask for!


# Traveling 
I also love traveling, and have been to: Ecuador, Columbia, Iceland, Ukraine, Spain, Amsterdam, France, Italy, Belize, and Canada (of course). Hopefully one day I will be a truly international scientist. Here are a few pictures from my travels:
