 <h1>My Academic Life Thus Far</h1>
 <div class="row">
     <div class="column">
       <p>After completing my degree at the University of Colorado Boulder, I was accepted to the department of computer science at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. My current research focuses on creating more princpled gradient based policy optimization algorithms for reinforcement learning. I beleive that by viewing <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00909.pdf">reinforcement learning as probabalistic inference</a><, we can improve our understanding of optimization withing RL, especially with respect to continuous proccesses. </p>

 <h2>Mountaineering</h2>

     <div class="column">
       <p> For anyone who has visited Boulder, my disposition and hobbies should come as no surprise. After getting out of high school, I took a year off and lived as a ski/mountain biking bum in Durango Colorado (and went to classes a bit too). Now that I am in Vancouver, I have all of whistler and Squamish at my disposle for all the world class climbing, biking, and skiing I could ask for! </p>

 <h3>Public Radio</h3>
 <div class="row">
     <div class="column">
       <p> During my time at CU, I also worked at the college radio station, first as a rotation DJ, then as a promotions director, then finally as a specialty show host. The first show that ran along with Jesse Birdman was an electronic show called Subharmony. The second, titled Probably Novel, was a talk show centered around creating approachable discussions of topics in STEM with REAL graduate and undergraduate researchers at CU.</p>
