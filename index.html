    <p>My name is Jonathan Wilder Lavington, and I'm currently a PhD student at the University of British Columbia, 
in the Department of Computer Science. My research interests currently include: stochastic optimization,
reinforcement learning, and variational inference. I have also contributed to research within the field of mathematical 
biology, specifically working on a project that modeled R-Loop formation within CRISPR-Cas9 genetic engineering systems.
