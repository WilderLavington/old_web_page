       <p>My name is Jonathan Wilder Lavington, and I'm currently a PhD student at the University of British Columbia Department of Computer Science.
          My research interests currently include: stochastic optimization, reinforcement learning, and variational inference. 
         I have also contributed to research within the field of mathematical biology, specifically working on a project that modeled R-Loop formation within CRISPR-Cas9 genetic engineering systems.
