	<h1>Greetings and salutations!</h1>
	<p>I'm currently a PhD student at the University of British Columbia, in the Department of Computer Science. 
  My research focuses on the investigation of generative models within machine learning and artificial intelligence.
  I have also contributed to research within the field of mathematical biology, specifically working on a project that modeled 
  R-Loop formation within CRISPR-Cas9 genetic engineering systems.
