title: "A Less Disorgonized Set of Notes on Statistical Learning"
date: 2018-06-10

My name is Jonathan Wilder Lavington, I am about to start a PhD in computer science at the University of British Columbia in the fall of 2018. I will be studying Computer Science, and plan to focus on the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning. As a result, I was interested in reading/rereading through a few of the more established textbooks, and creating a concise set of notes. I will try to commit to one or two posts every couple weeks reviewing a topic along side a brief code example. While I have had some exposure to a lot of this material from an applied mathematics perspective, I have yet to really investigate many of these topics. Additionally, I hope to create a better set of notes regarding each of these topics that I will iteratively add two as I become more and more comfortable with the topic. To anyone that actually reads these posts, feel free to add comments below if there is something that is incorrect, incomplete, or incomprehensable. The first set of notes will be effectively my own consolidation of the textbook "An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R", by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani. This textbook includes everything you need to get a cursory look at a lot of the topics within machine learning, so if you are interested please refer yourself to the text, which is presented online for free as a pdf. In ant case I look forward to seeing where this all goes!
